##Real-Time Digital Signal Processing
Real Time Digital Signal Processing on a Texas Instruments DSP processor. Part of EE3-19 Real-time Digital Signal Processing taught at Imperial College London
In cooperation with Tayyab Bhandari.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe at the time we were not able to finish this module. Instead the project has been done in python. The C files in the project folder are mere try-outs.
