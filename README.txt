The python files contain algorithms for signal detection.
The include pictures:
    3beepclassification: This picture shows 3 red lines where the algorithm predicted a beep. The used algorithm was solely based on cross correlation
    beepFFT : shows the sample of beep in the frequency domain
    beep : shows the sample of the beep in the time domain
    cross_correlationFFT : shows the cross correlation of the input signal (three beeps) and the sample signal (one beep)
