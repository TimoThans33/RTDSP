##Lab 5: IIR Filter Design
In this lab we learnt how to design IIR filters using Matlab and implement this on the C6713 DSK board. 
We have looked into three different implementation stylesL direct form I, direct form II and direct form II transposed.
We also measured our designed filter characteristics using a spectrum analyzer and compared this
to the design specification from Matlab
