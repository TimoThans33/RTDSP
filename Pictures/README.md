The results of the project are shown here.
* beepFFFT.png              # shows the beep in the time and frequency domain
* bestresult-noise.png      # shows the best achieved results from the algorithm on a noisy journal
* bestresult-nonoise.png    # shows the best result on a journal without noise
* crosscorrelation-for-different-windowsize.png # we have used a window size to reduce the resolution of the cross correlation
* Floor11_FFT.png           # shows the floor 11 sample in the time and frequency domain
